At first, you need to prepare the environment for your project. You can click on commands to copy them to the terminal.

Initiate your NPM project by running 
 
⌨️ `npm init -y`{{execute}}

👆👆👆 (PSSST... you don't have to type, those commands are clickable 😎)
 
 Install Syncano CLI by typing 
 
⌨️ `npm install -D @syncano/cli@canary`{{execute}}
 
 Initiate your first Syncano Project & create your Syncano account. The account you'll create can be used later - it's a free, fully-functional 90 days trial. You'll get details on your e-mail ✉️
 
⌨️ `npx s init`{{execute}} 

When asked for project template, please choose `Hello World Project Template`. 

```
npx is a npm command used for running code from your local node_modules instead of installing things globally.
