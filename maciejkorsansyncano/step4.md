Congratulations! You've made your first socket working! Let's change our socket's response. To do so go to the file `syncano/hello/src/hello.js` in the editor above. In line no. 8, replace `Hello` word with `My name is` (file autosaves when you make a change). Now type:

⌨️ `npx s deploy`{{execute}}

Now go back to your sample website and fill the form again. Your response should be changed.

That's it for now! You have a real, working Syncano account, and you can now try to build a real thing on your computer.
